This project involves the development of a password generator using the C++ programming language, aimed at enhancing data security by creating strong and unpredictable passwords. The program is designed 
to help users generate secure passwords that can be used to protect sensitive information and files.
The password generation logic incorporates a comprehensive set of characters, including:
Lowercase letters (a-z)
Uppercase letters (A-Z)
Numerical digits (0-9)
Special symbols (e.g., !, @, #, $, etc.)
By combining these character types, the generator ensures that each password is highly complex and difficult to guess or brute-force, thus offering a higher level of protection against unauthorized access.
The main objective of the project is to provide users with a simple yet powerful tool to create secure and unique passwords, thereby ensuring the authenticity and safety of their confidential files and 
personal information.
In the future, this password generator can be integrated into DigiLocker platforms or other secure data storage systems. It can be used to dynamically generate new passwords whenever a security breach or
privacy compromise is detected. This would significantly improve user safety by enabling systems to respond to threats proactively, thereby maintaining high standards of cybersecurity.
The project showcases the foundational use of C++ in building real-world security tools and highlights the importance of strong password generation in modern digital ecosystems.
